# 🎬 Cinema.com — Online Movie Platform (WIP) 🎥

Welcome to my Cinema Project! This is a multi-page web application I'm building to practice building complex UI layouts, user authentication flows, and dynamic content rendering. ( •̀ᴗ•́ )و

### 🚧 Current Status: Work In Progress 
I am currently working on:
- [ ] Integrating a real movie API (like TMDB).
- [ ] Enhancing the search functionality.
- [ ] Adding a "Favorites" list using LocalStorage.
- [ ] Adding more lists to movie genres.
- [ ] Changing the design since this project was made some years ago


**This project is a playground for my growth as a developer! Feel free to follow the progress.**
